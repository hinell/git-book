    dt  Description:
    dd  There are synopsis which i've gathered from my some notes and pieces of the
      a(href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2")  GIT Book (v2.0).


    dt  Version:
    dd  2.0

    H1 1.      Getting started.
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#13" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="13").
        1.3.    Git Basics.
    div(id="13").collapse
      
      dt    Snapshots.
      dd.
            Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git,
            it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment
            and stores a reference to that snapshot (if files have not changed,
      dd.
            Git doesn't store the file again (like others VCSs),
            just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.)
      dd    Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
      
      dt    Nearly Every Operation Is Local.
      dd.
            Git only need local files and resources to operate unlike
            other VCSs which have latency network overhead.
      
      dt    Git Has Integrity.
      dt    Git Generally Only Adds Data.

      dd    In Git, doing nearly all of actions, you only add data to the Git database.
      dd.
            It is very difficult to lose your data,
            especially if you regularly push your database to another repository.
      dd.
            Everything (files, dirs) in Git is check-summed before it's stored (to GIT) and
            is then referred to by that checksum.
      dd    This means it’s impossible to change the contents without Git knowing about it.
      dd    Git hash-mechanism: SHA-1
      dd    Git stored snapshots in DB by the hash.

    hr
    h1 2.      Git Basics.
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#21" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="21").
        2.1.     Getting a Git Repository
    div(id="21").collapse
      p.
      dt   Git initializing in an Existing Directory
      dd    Init in a current directory: [$ git init]

      dt   Cloning an Existing Repository.
      dd    You clone a repository with: [$ git clone [url]].

    
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#22" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="22").
        2.2.    Recording Changes to the Repository
    div(id="22").collapse
      dt    Recording Changes to the Repository
      dd
        p   Current dir - directory where git had initialized.
        ul  Each file in the current directory may have two states:
          ul
            li     untracked(не отслеживаемые)
            li     tracked  (отслеживаемые, in last snapshot)
        ul   Tracked files are files that were of the last snapshot; their states:
          ul
            li       unmodified
            li       modified
            li       staged

      

      dt  Checking the Status of Your Files
      dd      Check status of files in current dir: [$ git status]
      
      dt   Tracking New Files
      dd      Begin tracking new file:[ $ git add [file]]
      
      dt  Staging Modified Files
      dd      Git add is a multipurpose command – you use it to begin tracking new files,
      dd      to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved.
      
      dt  Ignoring Files
      dd      See .gitignore
      
      dt  Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes
      dd      [$ git diff] - shows you the exact lines added and removed – the patch, as it were.
      
      dt  Removing Files
      dd.
          Command: [$ git rm [file | dir]]
          This command simply delete tracked file.
      
      dt   Moving Files (Renaming)
      dd.
          If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:
          [$ git mv file_from file_to]
    
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#23" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="23").
      2.3.   Viewing the Commit History.
    div(id="23").collapse
      
      dt    Viewing the Commit History
      dd    To do this you need type the [$ git log] command.
      dd    One of the more helpful options is [-p], which shows the difference introduced in each commit.
      dd    You can also use [-2], which limits the output.


      dd    If you want to see some abbreviated stats for each commit, you can use the [--stat] option.
      dd    Another really useful option is [--pretty=oneline|short|full|fuller|format:]
      dd    Show graph: [$ git log --graph]
      dd    e.g.: [$ git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"]
      dd    More info available on the above link.

      dd    To see only the commits of a certain author: git log --author=bob

      dd    Different between committer and author is the author is the person who originally wrote the work,
      dd    whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work.
      
      dt      Limiting Log Output
      dd.
            With: [-<n>] where n is any integer to show the last n commits.
            The time-limiting options such as --since and --until.
            See other command in reference.

    
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#24" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="24").
      2.4.    Undoing Things
    div(id="24").collapse
      dt    Undoing Things
      dd    [$ git commit --amend]

      dt    Unstaging a Staged File
      dd    To unstage content in current dir, you can use: [$ git reset HEAD <file>] command:

      dt    Unmodifying a Modified File
      dd    You can replace local changes using the command:
      dd    [$ git checkout -- [file]] - be careful - is a dangerous command.
      dd    This kept files already added to the index,(new files).
      dd    Remember, anything that is committed in Git can almost always be recovered.
      dd.
            If you instead want to drop all your local changes, use:
            [$ git fetch origin]. It fetch the latest history
            from the server and point your local master branch.
    
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#25" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="25").
      2.5.     Working with Remotes
    div(id="25").collapse
      dd    Remote repositories are versions of your project
      dd    that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
      dd    Remotes enable you collaborate on any project remotely.
      dd    It is them porpose.

      dt    Showing Your Remotes
      dd    To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the [$ git remote]

      dt    Adding Remote Repositories
      dd    [$ git remote add [shortname] [url]]

      dt    Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes
      dd    As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects,
      dd    you can run:[$ git fetch [remote-name]]

      dd    For example, if you want to fetch all the information that remote repo has
      dd    but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run [$ git fetch [shortname]]
      dd    If you have a branch set up to track a remote branch, you can use
      dd    the [$ git pull] command to automatically fetch and then merge a remote branch into your current branch.


      dt    Pushing to Your Remotes
      dd    When you have your project at a point that you want to share,
      dd    you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple:
      dd    [git push [remote-name] [branch-name]]

      dt    Inspecting a Remote
      dd    If you want to see more information about a particular remote:
      dd    [$ git remote show [remote-name] ]

    
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#26" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="26").
      2.6.    Tagging
    div(id="26").collapse
      h2
      dt    Tagging
      dd      Typically people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, and so on).

      dt    Listing Your Tags
      dd      [$ git tag]
      dd    You can also search for tags with a particualar pattern like this
      dd    [$ git tag -l 'v1.*']

      dt    Creating Tags
      dd    Git uses two main types of tags:
        li lightweight
        li annotated.

      dd    A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn’t change – it’s just a pointer to a specific commit.
      dd    Annotated tags, are stored as full objects in the Git database
      dd    (including the tagger name, e-mail, date;
      dd    a tagging message; and can be signed / verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).)

      dt    Annotated Tags
      dd    The easiest way is to specify [-a | -m | -s ]: [$ git -a ]
      dd    e.g.: [$ git tag -a v.1.4 - 'my version 1.4']
      dd    To see tag data along with commit that was tagged, use: [$ git show [tagname]]

      dt    Lightweight Tags
      dd    To create a lightweight tag, don’t supply the -a, -s, or -m option, i.e:
      dd    [$ git tag v1.4-lw]

      dt    Tagging later
      dd    [$ git tag -a [tagName] [commit]] i.e.:
      dd    [$ git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02]

      dt    Sharing Tags
      dd    Just run: [$ git push origin [tagname]
      dd    By default the [$ git push] command doesn’t transfer tags to remote servers.
      dd    To push up at once a lot of tags you can use the:[$ git push --tags]

      dt    Checking out Tags
      dd    You can create a new branch at a specific tag:[$ git checkout -b [branchname] [tag(v.2 etc)]]
    
    H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#27" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="27").
      2.7.	Git Aliases
    div(id="27").collapse
      dd    You can easily set up an alias for each command using git config:
      dd    [$ git config --global alias.[nameOfNewCommand] ["git.command]"]
      dd    i.e.: [$ git config --global alias.co checkout]
      dd    However, maybe you want to run an external command
      dd    you start the command with a ! character.
      dd    e.g.: [$ git config --global alias.visual "!gitk"]

    h1 3. Git Branching
      H2(data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#31" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="31").
        3.1.	Branching in a Nutshell.
      div(id="31").collapse
        dd    Branching means you diverge from the main line of development
        dd    and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

        dt    Branching in a Nutshell
        dd    When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that
        dd    contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged.

        dt    Creating a New Branch
        dd    [$ git branch [branch name]]
        dd    How does Git know what branch you’re currently on?
        dd    It keeps a special pointer called HEAD.
        dd    Note that this is a lot different than the concept of HEAD
        dd    in other VCSs you may be used to, such as Subversion or CVS.
        dd    The git branch command only created a new branch – it didn’t switch to that branch.

        br
        dd    To see where the point of your HEAD, use:
        dd    [$ git log --oneline --decorate]

        dd    [$ git checkout [branch name]]
        dd    That command did two things.
        dd    It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the [branch name] branch,
        dd    and it reverted the files in your working directory
        dd    back to the snapshot that master points to.

        dd    [git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all]

        dd    At this stage, you’ll receive a call that another issue
        dd    is critical and you need a hotfix. You’ll do the following:
          ol
            li Switch to your production branch.
            li Create a branch to add the hotfix.
            li After it’s tested, merge the hotfix branch, and push to production.
            li Switch back to your original story and continue working.
        dt    Basic Merging
        dd    It’s worth pointing out that Git determines the best common ancestor to use
        dd    for its merge base; this is different than older tools like CVS or Subversion (before version 1.5)
